# ANN-for-ESP-Discharge-pressure-prediction-
This repository contains code and data for using artificial neural networks to predict and optimize the discharge pressure of electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) in oil wells. The goal is improving ESP performance, detecting anomalies, and preventing failures through accurate discharge pressure modeling. The MATLAB implementation and dataset.
